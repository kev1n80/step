      <div id="fact-container"></div>
      <p>I grew up in Miami, Florida surrounded by a Latinx community and playing 
          video games such as Starcraft 2 and Call of Duty. 
          I am currently a rising Sophomore at Northeastern University studying 
          computer science. 
          During my time at Northeastern I joined a salsa/bachata dance club called 
          Kaliente in order to maintain some resemblace of home while I was away 
          studying in Boston. 
          Growing up in Miami, a city centered around cars, I am fascinated with the 
          urban-planning model called superblocks that are being implemented in Spain! 
          I hope to one day travel to Spain and experience their culture rich cities.

      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>I love to offer my perspective of the world around me through photography. During 
          quarantine I have found that you can offer magical experiences through mundane 
          objects.

      <h3>Blog Posts</h3>
      <p>I have been exploring photography as a medium. I use to draw, but I stopped after 
          joining a sports team in my middle school. Now that I am in quarantine, I decided 
          to pick up a creative hobby such as photography.
