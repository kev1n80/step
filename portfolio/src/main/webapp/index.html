      <div id="fact-container"></div>
      <p>I grew up in Miami, Florida surrounded by a Latinx community and playing video games such as Starcraft 2 and Call of Duty. 
          I am currently a rising Sophomore at Northeastern University studying computer science. 
          During my time at Northeastern I joined a salsa/bachata dance club called Kaliente in order to maintain some resemblace of home while I was away studying in Boston. 
          Growing up in Miami, a city centered around cars, I am fascinated with the urban-planning model called superblocks that are being implemented in Spain! 
          I hope to one day travel to Spain and experience their culture rich cities.

      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>I love to offer my perspective of the world around me through photography. During quarantine I have found that you can offer magical experiences through mundane objects.</p>

      <h3>Blog Posts</h3>
      <p>I have been exploring photography as a medium. I use to draw, but I stopped after joining a sports team in my middle school. Now that I am in quarantine, I decided to pick up a creative 
          hobby such as photography.
