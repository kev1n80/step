            alt="Kaliente dance team">
      <p>I grew up in Miami, Florida surrounded by a Latinx community and playing video 
          games such as Starcraft 2 and Call of Duty. 
          I am currently a rising Sophomore at Northeastern University studying computer science. 
          During my time at Northeastern I joined a salsa/bachata dance club called Kaliente in 
          order to maintain some resemblace of home while I was away studying in Boston. 
          Growing up in Miami, a city centered around cars, I am fascinated with the urban-planning 
          model called superblocks that are being implemented in Spain! 
          I hope to one day travel to Spain and experience their culture rich cities.

      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>I love to offer my perspective of the world around me through photography. During 
          quarantine I have found that you can offer magical experiences through mundane 
          objects.</p>

            alt="sunset in a cup of coffee">
            <p>I was drinking coffee one day, which is rare, when I noticed that the foam
                 created by the coffee looked like 
                clouds. Then when I leaned the cup forward so as to drink it, the coffee 
                resembled the ocean and the back of 
                the cup resembled the sun. Finally, I just added a source of light behind 
                the cup and then BAM. Art</p>

      <h3>Blog Posts</h3>
      <p>I have been exploring photography as a medium. I use to draw, but I stopped after 
          joining a sports team in my middle school. Now that I am in quarantine, I decided 
          to pick up a creative 
          hobby such as photography.
