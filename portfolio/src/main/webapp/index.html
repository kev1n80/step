        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <img src="images/kaliente_team.jpg" alt="Kaliente dance team">
        <p>
          I grew up in Miami, Florida surrounded by a Latinx community and      
          playing video games such as Starcraft 2 and Call of Duty. 
          I am currently a rising Sophomore at Northeastern University studying 
          computer science. 
          During my time at Northeastern I joined a salsa/bachata dance club 
          called Kaliente in order to maintain some resemblace of home while I 
          was away studying in Boston. 
          Growing up in Miami, a city centered around cars, I am fascinated 
          with the urban-planning 
          model called superblocks that are being implemented in Spain! 
          I hope to one day travel to Spain and experience their culture rich 
          cities.

      <h2>Photography</h2>
      <p>
        I love to offer my perspective of the world around me through
        photography. 
        During quarantine I have found that you can offer magical 
        experiences through mundane objects.

          <p>
            Looking around my desk, I was inspired by the figurines that give 
            my workspace character. 
            When I looked at the fortune cookie I noticed how beautful 
            reflected light can be and the magical experience it gives. 
            When I prepared to take a picture of the fortune cookie I noticed 
            that the reflect light in front of Luke Skywalker makes it seem 
            like he is using the force.

          <p>
            I was drinking coffee one day, which is rare, when I noticed that 
            the foam created by the coffee looked like clouds. 
            Then when I leaned the cup forward so as to drink it, the coffee 
            resembled the ocean and the back of the cup resembled the sun. 
            Finally, I just added a source of light behind the cup and then 
            BAM. The photo was created.

            <h3>Quarantine Hobby</h3>
            <p>
              I have been exploring photography as a medium. 
              I use to draw, but I stopped after joining a sports team in my 
              middle school. 
              Now that I am in quarantine, I decided to pick up a creative hobby 
              such as photography.

            <h3>What Lead Me to Fencing</h3>
            <p>
              After watching the movie 300 I was motivated to learn how to use a sword. While I did not find a studio to teach me how to fight like a spartan, I stumbled across the sport of fencing specifically foil.
